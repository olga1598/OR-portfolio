                            <p>Hi, my name is Olga Repnitsyna. I am a hard-working, self-motivated and result-oriented individual looking to expand my knowledge and skills in the Information Technology field. I aspire to be a web developer and enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies. I am dedicated to perfecting existing skills by learning from more professional developers and continuously learn as much as I possibly can about being a software developer.</p>
                            <p>In June 2019 I have completed the George Washington University Bootcamp and got the certificate of Full Stack Web Developer. Since then, I've been learning continuously, worked on the projects, and completed a couple professional websites. I feel confident in my ability to learn more and my ability to work hard. I am especially eager to be a part of the team and to learn new technologies so that I can become a valuable employee and bring success to my future company.</p>
